Description: Parse SOPHAS application PDFs to extract GRE and GPA information.
  This package lacks evaluated examples and a vignette because it is intended
  for confidential applications to the SOPHAS (Schools of Public Health Application
  System). Note that there are more efficient ways to extract this information
  through the webadmit.org system; however faculty reviewers do not
  always have the necessary privileges to use these ways.
